# Notes and minimal instructions on using Docker
My notes on using docker, starting from nothing.

I will not cover a lot of theory, but explain a bit about the commands as I try them out

## The following is covered
* [01.basic-build](01.basic-build.md) - basic setup using a _Dockerfile_, build an image and run
* [02.php-cli-build](02.php-cli-build.md) - run a php script + size comparizon of some images
* [03.NGinx](03.Nginx.md) - Container with NGinx service that can be access from a browser
*
