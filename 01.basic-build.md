# Creating a completely basic container
Yutube video here: [Creating your first Dockerfile, image and container](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnxI-K10auY)

in essence
## Setup local folder to have the container content and specification
1. Create a new empty folder
2. Change to that folder
3. create the _Dockerfile_
4. Specify what image to build 'FROM' (is it possible not to use an image?)
5. specify a command to run

```bash
mkdir basic-build
cd basic-build
vi Dockerfile
```
Content of Docker file with command

```Dockerfile
FROM alpine

cmd ["echo", "hello from a docker image"]
```

Now build and run the docker image.
(I had to use a tag since the docker build command did not return the tag as specified in the video above, and then use the tag when starting the image)

```sh
docker build -t basic-build .
docker run basic-build
```
the reply should be:
>hello from a docker image

To run a script command instead of just calling echo.
1. Create a new script file in the base-build path (mark executable)
2. Add script code
3. Specify a copy command to include in the image
4. start the command

Create and mark executable
```sh
touch script.sh
chmod +x script.sh
vi script.sh
```
Insert some code in script.sh
```
#! /bin/sh
echo hello world, from a script file!
top
```

Modify the Dockerfile ```vi DockerFile```

```sh
FROM alpine
copy script.sh /script.sh
cmd ["/script.sh"]
```

build new image and run
```sh
docker build -t basic-build
docker run --name basic-build basic-build 
```

we are now stuck inside docker, so use another terminal to terminate the process, 
1. list the running docker processes
2. copy the name from the NAMES column
3. stop with docker stop
```
docker ps
```

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE         COMMAND        CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
2c9df2ffaab3   basic-build   "/script.sh"   2 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes             festive_bell
```

```
docker stop festive_bell
```
