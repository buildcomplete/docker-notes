# Creating a basic container running a php cli script.

## Setup local folder to have the container content and specification
1. Create a new empty folder
2. Change to that folder
3. create the _Dockerfile_
4. Specify what image to build 'FROM'
5. specify a command to run

Above is covered in [01.basic-build.md](01.basic-build.md#setup-local-folder-to-have-the-container-content-and-specification)

Content of Dockerfile:
```Dockerfile
FROM php:5.6-cli
COPY cli_script.php /usr/src/myapp/cli_script.php
WORKDIR /usr/src/myapp
CMD [ "php", "./cli_script.php" ]
```
the _cli_script.php_ print the phpinfo() to check php works from cli:

```php
<?php
phpinfo();
```

build and run:
```sh
docker build -t php-5.6-cli
docker run php-5.6-cli
```

__Notice__ I specified php:5.6-cli above, I have tried with several variant to see how I can run different version of php, and their size, the following images are tested:
* FROM php:5.6-cli
* FROM php:5.6-cli-alpine
* FROM php:7.4-cli
* FROM php:7.4-cli-alpine
* FROM php:8.1-cli
* FROM php:8.1-cli-alpine
