# Setup a basic nginx container

I wan't to configure as basic as possible an nginx container to understand more about Docker

## First create a docker file in a seperate folder 
This is covered in [01.basic-build.md](01.basic-build.md#setup-local-folder-to-have-the-container-content-and-specification)

Original content from here.
[How to Deploy an NGINX Image with Docker | NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/blog/deploying-nginx-nginx-plus-docker/)

I create a docker file with the following content
```Dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
RUN rm /etc/nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
COPY content /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY conf /etc/nginx
```

Notice that there are two _COPY_ commands, this is the get our own html and configuration to the server.

The following files are present to make nginx present our content

* [content\index.html](03.Nginx\content\index.html) the example index
* [content\page2.html](03.Nginx\content\page2.html) one more example, to see that links works
* [conf\nginx.conf](03.Nginx\conf\nginx.conf) minimal nginx configuration, the event section seems to be needed
* [conf\default.conf](03.Nginx\conf\default.conf) virtual server configuration, it could actually live inside [nginx.conf](03.Nginx\conf\nginx.conf), but the docker container was complaining that it was missing [default.conf](03.Nginx\conf\default.conf), so I tried to move the server section there and it worked with one less complaint

## Run and test
* build the image 
* and run it with port forwarding.

```sh
docker build -t nginx-alpine .
docker run --name nginx-run1 -p 80:80 nginx-alpine
```
At this point I can open the nginx server at `localhost:80`üê±‚Äçüèç

This is usefull for static sites hosting in a container
